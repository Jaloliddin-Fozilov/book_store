          'Imagine you fall asleep today and wake up in three hundred years! That\'s the story of Phra, the Phoenician, who has a rare gift of death-like sleep which makes him almost immortal. A reader gets introduced to Phra, a traveling Phoenician warrior, as he saves a slave girl, falls in love with her, and decides to bring her back home to Britannia. From there starts his incredible life journey through different eras of British history, ending up in the Elizabethan age. Each of his long periods of sleep relates to an invasion. For the first time, it happens during Caesar\'s invasion of Britain. ',

It amounted in the long run to a sort of secret society; it had its president, but no one outside its numbers knew who he was.
